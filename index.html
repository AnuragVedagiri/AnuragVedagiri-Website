        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Iâ€™m Anurag, an engaging and motivated freshman pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s in Business Administration at the University of California, Riverside. Adaptable and driven with a strong work ethic and ability to thrive in a team-based or individually-motivated setting. Iâ€™m eager to join a business-related internship over the summer of 2020 and want to learn from as well as establish keen and long-lasting relationships with co-workers and employees. 
Some extracurricular activities Iâ€™ve enjoyed as a hobby are Boy Scouts. I have served over 7 leadership postions and helped develop younger scouts to understand concepts of scouting and community work. I received my Eagle Scout award on August 16th, 2019. I am also a first-degree black belt at JTC Taekwondo in San Jose, CA. I received my black belt in May 2018. Lastly, I have played baseball in all 4 years of high school, receiving the honor of co-captain my senior year of high school.
<br><br>

        I am involved in a club American Marketing Association (AMA) in UCR which primarily focuses on developing students into successful leaders in the field of marketing, management, advertising, public relations, sales, and other related fields. Due to AMA, I have been able to participate in numerous professional events, conferences, and other workshops including the 2020 Business Student Leadership Conference (BSLC). I have been able to polish my communication skills, self-branding, and emotional intelligence. This has helped me develop my professional self, leadership, and maintain focus on success. Iâ€™ve currently applied for an officer position on board for the upcoming year: Internal/External Affairs Coordinator.
Iâ€™m also involved heavily in Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA). As a member of the club, Iâ€™ve been graced with the opportunities of determining and recommending methods to address improvement opportunities. Iâ€™ve been able to practice monitoring social media and online sources for industry trends. Iâ€™ve provided observations, took measurements and performed tests at various workshops to develop skills Attended interactive workshops touching a variety of personal/professional topics including Customer Engagement, Advertising, and LinkedIn.
<br><br>

        Apart from clubs, Iâ€™ve been able to volunteer in Boy Scouts at high adventure trips and around my community. Iâ€™ve planned, modeled, and built 2 wooden rolling carts, fundraised for money possible through bake sales and donated carts to Dorsa Elementary in San Jose, and have organized numerous trips in Boy Scouts, including serving as a leader to Canada's Northern Tier and New Mexico's Philmont. Due to the many opportunities to volunteer, Iâ€™ve been able to record over 500 hours of community service.
As I look back on my many years of scouting, I can vividly see the remarkable effect it had on my personality, relationships, and general life skills. I plan to carry these lessons and experiences with me through life and use them to benefit my family, friends, community, and myself. As I continue into the future, the lessons of scouting will not only help fulfill my goals but also help embellish life.
